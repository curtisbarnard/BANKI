Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time 😉)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
